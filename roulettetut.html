            <p>
                To make money playing roulette, correctly guess the number or type of number the ball will land on when the dealer spins the wheel.
            </p>

            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>
                All roulette games require a wheel and a table.
                Both the roulette wheel and table contain 36 numbers, 0, and 00.
                In this online version, the dealer (or a small white ball in real life) will randomly select (or the ball will land on) one of the wheels numbered slots.
                Before that, you will place your bet on the table where you think the ball will land in.
                If you predict the slot correctly, you get paid.
                In addition to numbers, roulette tables offer a few other betting options including:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>1-18:</b></li>
                    <li><b>19-36</b></li>
                    <li><b>Even</b></li>
                    <li><b>Odd</b></li>
                    <li><b>Black</b></li>
                    <li><b>1st 12:</b> counts as a bet for all numbers 1-12</li>
                    <li><b>2st 12:</b> counts as a bet for all numbers 13-24</li>
                    <li><b>3st 12:</b> counts as a bet for all numbers 25-36</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Step-by-Step</h2>
            <p>
                <b>1.</b>
                There are various betting options in Roulette. 
                You can bet on individual numbers, group numbers, or characteristics such as red/black or odd/even. 
                Each bet has different odds and payouts.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>2.</b>
                Once you understand the betting options, place your chips on the corresponding areas of the Roulette table. 
                You can spread your chips across multiple bets for better odds or concentrate them on one or a few options for higher payouts.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>3.</b>
                After all bets are placed, the dealer "spins the wheel" and a small ball in the opposite direction. 
                The ball eventually lands in one of the numbered pockets. 
                You win if it lands on a number or characteristic you bet on.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>6.</b>
                After the round ends, bets are paid out and you will have the option to start a new round.
            </p>
