                In Blackjack, you are betting against the dealer.
                The goal of the game is to get a higher hand than the dealer without going over 21. Going over 21 is called busting.
                If you have a  better hand than the dealer without busting, they win their bet. If they have a worse hand, the dealer takes their bet.

            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>
                The goal of Blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.
                You will determine the value of their hand by tallying up the point values of their cards:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>2-10:</b> The number listed on the card is equivalent to it's worth (Ex: 2 = 2 points)</li>
                    <li><b>Jack, Queen, & King:</b> 10 points</li>
                    <li><b>Ace:</b> 1 or 11 points (You choose!)</li>
                </ul>
                An Ace and a 10, Jack, Queen, or King equals 21 points and is known as Blackjack.
            </p>

            <h2>Rules Step-by-Step</h2>
            <p>
                <b>1.</b>
                You make a bet with your chips.
                You must submit your bet before the round officially starts. 
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>2.</b>
                The dealer gives a card to you and as well as themselves.
                The dealer hands a card face-up to you and then places a card face-down in front for themselves.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>3.</b>
                The dealer hands out a second card to you.
                As they did before, the dealer passes another face-up card to you.
                this time, the dealer places their second card face-up in their hand (leaving the first card face-down still).
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>4.</b>
                Decide if you want to stay or hit.
                Look at your 2 cards and add them up to see if it's close to or is 21.
                If the total is above 17, "standing" your best option.
                If your total is on the low end, like sigle digits, "hitting" could be beneficial.
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Standing</b> means that you don't want a another card that'll add to your total.</li>
                    <li><b>Hitting</b> means that you'd like to add another card to your hand. You can hit as many times as you want until you reach, go over 21, or decide to stand.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>5.</b>
                Once you stand, the dealer will reveal their hand total.
                If the total is 16 or lower, the dealer is required to hit and take another card.
                If the card is 17 or higher, the dealer is required to stand.
            </p>

            <p>
                If the dealer gets a Blackjack, you will automatically lose the round, unless you have a Blackjack yourself.
                In this case, they "push".
                When you've got a Blackjack, you'll simply get the bet back.
                A push can also oocur anytime your hand matches the dealer's.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>6.</b>
                After the round ends, bets are paid out and you will have the option to start a new round.
            </p>
